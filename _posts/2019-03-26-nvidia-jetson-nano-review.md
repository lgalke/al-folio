# Evaluating NVIDIA's Jetson Nano as a Personal Deep Learning Station


## Installing pytorch

Unfortunately, installing [pytorch](https://pytorch.org) was not going smoothly
out of the box.  The official pytorch builds do not include wheels for the
AArch64 architecture.  NVIDIA provides, however, precompiled binaries.  Follow
this
[guide](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1049071/jetson-nano/pytorch-for-jetson-nano/),
installation of pytorch went smoothly.
