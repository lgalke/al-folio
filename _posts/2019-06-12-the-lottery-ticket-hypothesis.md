### The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis: Finding Sparse, Trainable Neural Networks {% cite 2018arXiv180303635F --file references %}

* Lottery Ticket Conjecture: SGD seeks out and trains a
  well-initialized subnetwork
* By this logic, overparameterized networks are easier to train
  because they have more combinations of subnetworks that are potential winning tickets.

* Iterative magnitude pruning at initialization is problematic for deeper networks.
* The authors propose to not prune at initialization but after few training epochs.
