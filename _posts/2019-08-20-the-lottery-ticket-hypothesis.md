#### introduction

Neural networks become larger and larger and use up to billions of parameters.
Researchers start to quantify the effort to train these large-scale models in
\$\$\$ amounts on cloud computing platforms and even in tons of carbon
emissions. The common understanding used to be that overparametrized networks
have more capacity but are also more prone to overfit the training data. Recent
studies have shown that overparametrization, in fact, acts as a regularizer and
lead to improved generalization performance that no other regularization
technique may achieve[^arora2018].

After training, however, large parts of such large-scale models can be pruned
away without harming the accuracy of the model. Pruning techniques date back to
1990 with LeCun et al.'s paper on *optimal brain damage*[^braindmg]. The
motivation for pruning is to reduce the model size and thus, memory
requirements, inference times, and energy consumption. One pruning technique is
*magnitude pruning*, which prunes those weights that have the lowest magnitude,
and therefore, the lowest effect on the network output[^mp].

Before the lottery ticket hypothesis[^lth] (LTH), the shared opinion was that
pruned architectures were harder to train from scratch. Now, the LTH states
that certain subnetworks can be trained to match or even outperform the
accuracy of the original, unpruned network. The key idea is to iteratively
train a network and prune its parameters until only a small fraction of
parameters are remaining. In each iteration, the surviving weights are reset to
their values at initialization. The resulting subnetwork can then be trained in
comparable time to match the accuracy the accuracy of original network. These
subnetworks are referred to as *winning tickets*.

> **The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.** A randomly-initialized, dense neural
> network contains a subnetwork that is initialized such that—when trained in
> isolation—it can match the test accuracy of the original network after
> training for at most the same number of iterations.[^lth]

In the LTH paper, the authors have found such winning tickets that are
only 10-20% of the size of their dense counterparts. With more retained
parameters, the winning tickets could even achieve higher test accuracies than
the original networks.

Why is this important? The LTH suggests that it is not necessary to train
a full-model, if we could only identify winning tickets early in the training
process. If this was possible, it could save us wallets of \$\$\$ and tons of
carbon emissions. 

#### thought experiment: sum of two inputs
 
To get an intuition on the LTH, let's consider the simple task of computing the sum of two inputs $$y = x_0 + x_1 $$.
We want to approximate the ground truth $$y$$ with a two-layer, linear neural net with $$n$$ hidden units and no bias.

$$f(x) = \sum_i^n w^{(2)}_i (w^{(1)}_{i,1} x_1 + w^{(1)}_{i,2} x_2)$$

<center>
<img src="/assets/img/LTH.png" alt="exemplary neural net with a winning ticket" width="80%"/>
</center>

For humans, a winning ticket for the sum of two inputs is easy to determine.
Such a winning ticket would be $$w^{(1)}_{i,1} = w^{(1)}_{i,2} = w^{(2)}_{i} = 1$$ for some $$i$$ with all remaining weights being zero.
This winning ticket would even generalize out of the training data domain, as it
actually does compute the real sum of its two inputs.

No matter how large we chose the hidden layer size $$n$$, our winning ticket will always consist of three nonzero weights.
Thus, we can prune all but those three weights without harming accuracy.
An alternative would be that the input values are passed through the first layer and summed up in the second layer, which would need four weights in total.
When we start training with a mask for those three (or four) nonzero connections, the network will eventually learn the correct weights.

#### how to identify winning tickets

To show that winning tickets exist, Frankle and Carbin[^lth] employ the following procedure, which they label *iterative magnitude pruning*:

1. Initialize model with parameters $$\theta_0$$ along with a mask $$m$$ set to 
   all ones
2. Train the (masked) model for $$j$$ iterations 
3. Prune the lowest magnitude parameters and update $$m$$ accordingly.
4. Reset $$\theta[m]$$ to their values in $$\theta_0$$ and fix all other
   parameters to zero.
5. Repeat from step 2 unless stopping criterion on sparsity or
   validation accuracy is met 

The result is a subnetwork (given by mask m) along with its initialization, which may perform a final training pass.
In their experiments on image classification[^lth], the authors compare the accuracy of these winning tickets against the whole model and against random tickets.
Random tickets share the same structure but are re-initialized randomly before the final training pass.
The main result is that the winning tickets consistently lead to higher scores than random tickets, and can also match or even outperform the full models.

So, random tickets share the same structure as winning tickets yet winning
tickets yield higher scores. This means that the initialization values are
important for the winning tickets' success. When we have more parameters, we
get more rolls for initialization values. The authors of the LTH paper
conjecture that already the optimizer focuses on training the parameters of
a well-initialized sub-network. Why do e need to start with a big model in the
first place? The idea is that we get more possible combinations of subnetworks
when you have more parameters in total. This may be an alternative explanation
why highly overparametrized networks generalize better.

#### iterative magnitude pruning

Frankle and Carbin make use of a pruning technique proposed by Han et al.[^mp]
at NeurIPS 2015. That is to prune those weights that have the lowest magnitude
and retrain them. Han et al. have shown that, counterintuitively, magnitude
pruning works better with L2 regularization as soon the remaining weights are
retrained. They further show that iterative pruning is favorable over one-shot
pruning. In one-shot pruning, you would only conduct only a single training
pass and then prune the weights, whereas in iterative pruning, you would prune
and train for several rounds until some criterion on sparsity or accuracy is
met.

To validate the lottery ticket hypothesis, Frankle & Carbin ought to find
subnetworks that match the accuracy of the original nets, when *trained in
isolation*. That means that they cannot exploit the benefit from previous
training rounds with the full model. Therefore, they modify the training and
pruning procedure by resetting (non-pruned) weight values to their
values at initializion.

During pruning, you can either prune to the desired fraction of weights at each
layer, or put the weights of all layers into one pool and prune globally. In
the LTH paper[^lth], the authors use local pruning for LeNet and Conv-2/4/6,
while they use global pruning for the deeper models: Resnet-18 and VGG-19. The
idea is that within deeper models, the weights of some layers might be more
important to keep than others'[^trf2].

#### late resetting

Learning rate warmup can help to find winning tickets for deeper models[^lth].
In follow-up work, however, the authors have introduced a different technique to deal with deeper models: late resetting[^lth-at-scale].
With late resetting, the weights are reset to values early in the training process instead of strictly to their initial values.
Hence, learning rate warm-up is not necessary anymore. Late resetting is specifically important to find winning tickets for deeper models.
Technically, late resetting relaxes the lottery ticket hypothesis a little.
Though, the authors rewind the parameters to early values in the training
process (0.1% -- 7% through). Therefore, the potential implications of the
lottery ticket hypothesis are only marginally affected: "you don't need to
train *much* before you could prune".


#### winning tickets outside of the image domain

Is the lottery ticket phenomenon an artefact of supervised image classification with feed-forward convolutional nets nets or does it generalize to other domains?
Yu et al.[^lth-nlp] could show that winning tickets also exist in reinforcement learning and natural language processing architectures.
Their experiments include classic control problems and Atari games for reinforcement learning, as well as LSTMs and Transformers for NLP.
They managed to find winning tickets for all architectures.
This suggests that the LTH phenomenon is not restricted to supervised image classification but might be a general property of deep neural nets.

#### transferring winning tickets

So far, the procedure to identify winning tickets is still expensive as it
involves several full training passes. How can we still benefit from the
winning tickets? Can we transfer them to other tasks such that only a small
fraction of weights need to be learned for the target task?

Two papers have already addressed this question: Mehta 2019[^trf1] and Morcos
et al.[^trf2]. Both works stay in the image domain and transfer winning tickets
across different object recognition tasks. Both works suggest that winning
tickets are transferable across tasks.

Mehta[^trf1] relaxes late resetting to using the best weights anywhere in the
training process on the source task. His reasonable explanation is that the
purpose of transfer learning is to save training effort on the target task. His
experiments on CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and SmallNORB  show that winning tickets
are transferable even though 90-95% of the weights were removed. Please note
that, the final fully-connected layers are fine-tuned. Fine-tuning the final
fully-connected layers is mandatory in these transfer learning scenarios
because different tasks have different classes.

Morcos et al. 2019[^trf2] have conducted large-scale experiments on transfer
learning within the image domain. The study considers VGG19 and ResNet50
architectures on CIFAR-10/100, FashionMNIST and MNIST while also varying the
optimizer (SGD and Adam). Their results suggest that winning tickets are not
specific to a certain optimizer. For instance, a winning ticket obtained via
SGD training can be used to initialize weights that are then trained by Adam.
Regarding transfer across tasks, the authors have compared winning tickets from
other datasets to winning tickets obtained on the same dataset. Surprisingly,
winning tickets from other datasets are nearly as good as tickets obtained on
the same dataset. A key result is that larger datasets produce more generic
winning tickets.

#### how do winning tickets look like

Zhou et al.[^deconstruct] have closely investigated the properties of winning
tickets. They show that a crucial element of the initialization values are
their signs. It seems that the actual magnitude of the initialization value is
less important. That might give a clue that optimizers struggle to adjust
a negative attribution into a positive one and vice versa.

They further hypothesize that masking certain weights to zero is similar to
performing training iterations. The information that a certain feature will be
irrelevant for the current classification task is as precious as conducting
actual training iterations.

After analyzing different pruning and alteration criteria, the authors further
claim that sparse subnetworks work particularly well, when initializations are
close to their final form. Building on top of this hypothesis, the authors go
even further and develop the notion of supermasks, which are mere
initializations of masks and values that are not trained at all.
Interestingly, these supermasks yield accuracy scores that are far better than
chance.

#### pruning and dropout

Dropout is a well-known regularization method that encourages sparsity tolerance during training by setting a random fraction of weights or hidden units to zero.
However, when pruning is applied after training, the fraction of pruned weights depend on a heuristic such as the magnitude of the weights.
Gomez et al.[^tgt-drop] pursue the idea of improving the interaction of dropout and pruning.
The idea is that dropout could be targeted to units, which are likely to be pruned, i.e., those with low magnitude.
In the paper, the authors analyze not only the standard unit-dropout but also weight-dropout (aka DropConnect), which is even closer to the employed pruning techniques.


#### pruning on-the-go

The holy grail of winning tickets is to identify them as early as possible in the training process.
Dettmers and Zettlemoyer[^fromscratch] propose a technique to identify winning tickets without the need for expensive retraining.
They exploit the momentum of the gradients to determine how fast weights change during training and prune those that do not change much.
Furthermore, the values of pruned weights are redistributed dynamically.
The results show that this so-called sparse momentum technique outperforms their baselines for sparse learning.

#### limitations

There are also studies that challenge the LTH:
Gale et al.[^ch1] conduct a large-scale comparison of sparse neural nets on
machine translation with transfomers and image classification with ResNet-50.
They confirm that naive magnitude pruning[^mp] is the best pruning technique among the compared ones. However, they report that the LTH approach fails to find winning tickets for these architectures.
Liu et al[^ch2] show that -- with a carefully selected learning rate -- random tickets can perform as well as winning tickets.
Both works, however, did not yet use late resetting[^lth-at-scale],
which helps to find winning tickets especially in deep architectures.


#### hands-on: experiments on the sum-of-two-inputs example

Before we conclude, let's return to our sum-of-two-inputs example from [above](#a-toy-example-sum-of-two-inputs).
We use local pruning such that the second layer does not get pruned away
completely.
We begin with 200 hidden units and train for 10 epochs for each pruning round.
We iteratively prune 25% of the weights (by magnitude) until only 2 weights are left in each layer.
In each round, we use late resetting to the weights after the first training iteration.
We expect that the winning ticket will pass the two inputs through the first
layer and sum them up in the second layer.
We train on the interval [-1,1] and test on the interval [1,2].
We end up with the following results for the root mean squared error.

```
Pruning 0.25 weights => 4 weights still active ~= 0.67%
Stopping criterion met.
This is your winning ticket:
        Layer 0
        [60,0]: 0.9429353475570679
        [60,1]: 0.9429353475570679
        Layer 1
        [0,60]: 1.06050705909729
        [0,101]: -0.4135688245296478
Winning ticket RMSE: 6.870159915858438e-05
This is a random ticket:
        Layer 0
        [60,0]: -0.8950394988059998
        [60,1]: -0.8950406908988953
        Layer 1
        [0,60]: -1.1172559261322021
        [0,101]: 0.008170465007424355
Reinit Random ticket RSME: 7.364383157981381e-05
This is a permuted random ticket:
        Layer 0
        [2,0]: 0.15243083238601685
        [2,1]: -0.40985623002052307
        Layer 1
        [0,60]: -0.002661715727299452
        [0,101]: 0.03881140798330307
Permute+Reinit Random ticket RSME: 6.60740392345907
Full-model RSME: 7.780414107555133e-06
```

We observe that iterative magnitude pruning yields a winning ticket that
corresponds to our human intuition (or at least, it is quite close).
Please note that the [0,101] weight on the second layer irrelevant as it will only ever receive zero inputs.
The winning ticket's accuracy with 4 weights is on par with
the accuracy of the full model with 600 weights. The randomly reinitialized
ticket also succeeds to learn good weights (the inverted signs cancel each other out).
In contrast, the locally permuted ticket has a dead end and cannot learn anything.

What can we learn from implementing the "sum-of-two-inputs" toy example?

1. We can verify our previous thought-experiment that it is possible to find
   a winning ticket with only four weights that leads comparable error as the
   full 600 parameter model.
2. For this simple task, the initialization of winning tickets might be less
   important than it is in more complex tasks. The connectivity itself is more important.
3. We see that a comparison with randomly permuted tickets is dangerous. The
   random permutation has lead to a "dead end", which may render the model
   untrainable.

#### conclusion

The lottery ticket hypothesis states that dense neural networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match the performance of the
dense net. This phenomenon offers a novel interpretation of
overparametrization, which behaves as having much more draws (possible subnetworks) from the lottery.
To benefit from their existence, one needs to find methods to identify winning
tickets early and without training the full model at all. Some approaches
already tackle this, while others focus on training methods that make neural
networks more amenable to later pruning. If we could identify winning tickets
early or transfer them to other domains, we would save substantial amounts of
training effort. Winning tickets sometimes even outperform the original
networks, which might have implications for our understanding of and the design
of architectures and their initializations. We can confirm that
iterative magnitude pruning succeeds to finds winning tickets that correspond
to human wisdom for a simple toy task.
