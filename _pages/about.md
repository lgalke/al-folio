I am a second-year PhD student advised by [Ansgar
Scherp](http://ansgarscherp.net). I work part-time at [Kiel
University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en) and part-time at [ZBW -- Leibniz
Information Centre for Economics](https://zbw.eu). In my spare time, I
contribute to the [MTank](http://www.themtank.org/) to use AI to make AI research more accessible.
My research interests reside in machine learning and natural language processing.
In particular, neural networks, autoencoders, and self-supervised learning spark joy.
