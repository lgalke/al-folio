I am a PhD student at [Kiel University](www.uni-kiel.de/en) since 2017.
I work part-time as a teaching assistant at Kiel University and part-time for a
third-party funded project at [ZBW -- Leibniz Information Centre for Economics](https://zbw.eu).
Before, I received both my bachelor's degree (2013) and my master's degree (2017) in computer science from Kiel University. 

My research interests comprise machine learning and natural language processing.
Neural networks and especially autoencoders spark joy in my heart.
