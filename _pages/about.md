I am a PhD student at [Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en) since 2017. I work
part-time at Kiel University and part-time at [ZBW -- Leibniz Information
Centre for Economics](https://zbw.eu). Before, I received both my bachelor's
(2013) and master's degree (2017) in computer science from Kiel
University. My research interests comprise machine learning and natural
language processing.
