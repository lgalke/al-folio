I am a PhD student at [Kiel University](www.uni-kiel.de/en) since 2017.  I work
part-time as a teaching assistant at Kiel University and part-time at [ZBW --
Leibniz Information Centre for Economics](https://zbw.eu).  Before, I received
both my bachelor's degree (2013) and my master's degree (2017) in computer
science from Kiel University. 

My research interests comprise machine learning and natural language processing.
Neural networks and especially autoencoders spark joy in my heart.
