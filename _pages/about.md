Hi there,

I am a PhD student at [Kiel University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en) advised by
[Ansgar Scherp](http://ansgarscherp.net). I work at [ZBW -- Leibniz Information
Centre for Economics](https://zbw.eu).
Before starting my PhD in 2017, I completed a Master's in Computer Science at Kiel
University.

My area of interest comprises neural networks at the intersection of text and graph data.
I've worked on text classification, information retrieval, unsupervised text
representation learning, and hybrid recommender systems.
Right now, I'm working on lifelong learning open world node classification
and distilling the knowledge from large-scale pretrained language models into
more efficient architectures.

<!-- A side result of my Master's project was that neural networks could -->
<!-- outperform (back then) predominant k-Nearest-Neighbors approaches in extreme -->
<!-- multi-label short text classification by a large margin (K-CAP 2017). In my Master's thesis, -->
<!-- I've investigated the use of word embeddings for similarity scoring in practical -->
<!-- information retrieval and found that combining word embeddings with classical -->
<!-- term-weighting schemes consistently leads to an improved retrieval performance (INFORMATIK 2017). -->
