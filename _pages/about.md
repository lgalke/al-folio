I am a PhD student advised by [Ansgar
Scherp](http://ansgarscherp.net) and just started my third year. I work at [Kiel
University](https://www.uni-kiel.de/en) and at [ZBW -- Leibniz Information
Centre for Economics](https://zbw.eu). In my spare time, I contribute to the
[MTank](http://www.themtank.org/).

My research interests comprise self-supervised learning on semi-structured data.
In particular, that covers learning representations in text-attributed graphs.
I'm most passionate about autoencoders, graph convolution, and Shannon entropy.
