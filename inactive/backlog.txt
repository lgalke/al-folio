#### l1 and l2 regularization terms

An L1 penalty on the weights of a neural network encourages sparse weights.
Counterintuitively, an L2 penalty leads to neural nets that
are more amenable to pruning than nets trained with an L1 penalty.

#### identifying winning tickets early

To benefit from winning tickets at training time, it is not enough to know that a winning ticket exists.
The holy grail is how to identify winning tickets early in the training process.
Dettmers and Zettlemoyer[^fromscratch] do propose such an approach already.

These subnetworks are called *winning tickets*.
The author's compare the trained accuracy of winning tickets against randomly initialized weights with the same structure (*random tickets*).
