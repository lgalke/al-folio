Current graph convolution approaches are promising, especially, when all the graph{\rq}s nodes and edges are available during training. When unseen nodes and edges are inserted after training, it is not yet evaluated whether up-training or re-training from scratch is preferable. We construct an experimental setup, in which we insert previously unseen nodes and edges after training and conduct a limited amount of inference epochs. In this setup, we compare adapting pretrained graph neural networks against retraining from scratch. Our results show that pretrained models yield high accuracy scores on the unseen nodes and that pretraining is preferable over retraining from scratch. Our experiments represent a first step to evaluate and develop truly online variants of graph neural networks.},

	abstract = {Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) is a powerful text embedding method.
            Due to its strong capabilities to encode word content, CBOW
            embeddings perform well on a wide range of downstream tasks while
            being efficient to compute. However, CBOW is not capable of
            capturing the word order. The reason is that the computation of
            CBOW's word embeddings is commutative, i.e., embeddings of XYZ and
            ZYX are the same. In order to address this shortcoming, we propose
            a learning algorithm for the Continuous Matrix Space Model, which
            we call Continual Multiplication of Words (CMOW). Our algorithm is
            an adaptation of word2vec, so that it can be trained on large
            quantities of unlabeled text. We empirically show that CMOW better
            captures linguistic properties, but it is inferior to CBOW in
            memorizing word content. Motivated by these findings, we propose a
            hybrid model that combines the strengths of CBOW and CMOW. Our
            results show that the hybrid CBOW-CMOW-model retains CBOW's strong
            ability to memorize word content while at the same time
            substantially improving its ability to encode other linguistic
            information by 8\%. As a result, the hybrid also performs better on
            8 out of 11 supervised downstream tasks with an average
            improvement of 1.2\%.},

              documents. On the one hand, the full-text of documents like
              scientific papers is not always available due to, e.g., copyright
              policies of academic publishers. On the other hand, conducting a

              short and therefore may not contain enough information to yield
              satisfactory search results. In this paper, we compare different

              By suggesting appropriate tracks, i.\,e., songs to add to a

              by making playlist creation easier, as well as extending
              listening beyond the end of current playlist. The ACM Recommender

              dataset of playlists, which includes a large number of playlists
              and associated track listings. Given a set of playlists from
              which a number of tracks have been withheld, the goal is
              predicting the missing tracks in those playlists. We participated
              in the challenge as the team \emph{Unconscious Bias} and, in this
              paper, we present our approach. We extend adversarial

	abstract = {For (semi-)automated subject indexing systems in digital
              libraries, it is often more practical to use metadata such as the
              title of a publication instead of the full-text or the abstract.
              Therefore, it is desirable to have good text mining and text
              classification algorithms that operate well already on the title
              of a publication. So far, the classification performance on
              titles is not competitive with the performance on the full-texts
              if the same number of training samples is used for training.
              However, it is much easier to obtain title data in large
              quantities and to use it for training than full-text data. In
              this paper, we investigate the question how models obtained from
              training on increasing amounts of title training data compare to
              models from training on a constant number of full-texts. We
              evaluate this question on a large-scale dataset from the medical
              domain (PubMed) and from economics (EconBiz). In these datasets,
              the titles and annotations of millions of publications are
              available, and they outnumber the available full-texts by a
              factor of 20 and 15, respectively. To exploit these large amounts
              of data to their full potential, we develop three strong deep
              learning classifiers and evaluate their performance on the two
              datasets. The results are promising. On the EconBiz dataset, all
              three classifiers outperform their full-text counterparts by a
              large margin. The best title-based classifier outperforms the
              best full-text method by 9.9\%. On the PubMed dataset, the best
              title-based method almost reaches the performance of the best

            We assess the suitability of word embeddings for practical information
            retrieval. While limiting ourselves to unsupervised models, we compare the
            performance of several techniques that leverage word embeddings to retrieval
            models (i.\ e.\@,  provide a query-document similarity): the intuitive word
            centroid similarity, dedicated paragraph vectors, the physically inspired Word
            Mover's distance, as well as a novel IDF re-weighted word centroid similarity.

            In our comparison, we thrive to simulate a strictly practical setting: short
            queries, a boolean matching operation, only the first twenty retrieved
            documents are considered. We evaluate the performance using the ranking metrics
            mean average precision, mean reciprocal rank and normalised discounted
            cumulative gain. Additionally, we inspect the retrieval models' sensitivity to
            document length by using either only the title or the full-text as documents.

            We conclude that word centroid similarity is the best competitor to
            state-of-the-art retrieval models and can be further improved by re-weighting
            the word frequencies according to inverse document frequency before aggregating
            the respective word vectors of the embedding. The proposed cosine similarity of
            IDF re-weighted word vectors is competitive to the TF-IDF baseline and even

            In the context of this research contribution, a dedicated information retrieval
            framework has been developed. The key features include the incorporation of
            embedding-based retrieval models, the simulation of a practical setting,
            automatic evaluation as well as convenient extendability by new retrieval
            models. The corresponding user's guide and developer's guide are part of this
