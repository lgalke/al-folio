  abstract={Large-scale graph data in real-world applications is often not static but dynamic, i.\,e., new nodes and edges appear over time.
            Current graph convolution approaches are promising, especially, when all the graph's nodes and edges
            are available during training.
            When unseen nodes and edges are inserted after training, it is not yet
            evaluated whether up-training or re-training from scratch is preferable.
            We construct an experimental setup, in which we insert previously unseen
            nodes and edges after training and conduct a limited amount of further (inference) epochs. 
            In this setup, we compare adapting pretrained graph neural networks against retraining from
            scratch.
            Our results show that pretrained models yield high accuracy scores despite 
            changes in the graph structure and that pretraining is preferable over retraining from scratch. 
            Our experiments represent a first step to evaluate and develop
            truly online variants of graph neural networks.}

  title={{CBOW} Is Not All You Need: Combining {CBOW} with the Compositional Matrix Space Model},

  year={2019},
  url={https://openreview.net/forum?id=H1MgjoR9tQ},
  abstract={Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) is a powerful text embedding method.
            Due to its strong capabilities to encode word content, CBOW
            embeddings perform well on a wide range of downstream tasks while
            being efficient to compute. However, CBOW is not capable of
            capturing the word order. The reason is that the computation of
            CBOW's word embeddings is commutative, i.e., embeddings of XYZ and
            ZYX are the same. In order to address this shortcoming, we propose
            a learning algorithm for the Continuous Matrix Space Model, which
            we call Continual Multiplication of Words (CMOW). Our algorithm is
            an adaptation of word2vec, so that it can be trained on large
            quantities of unlabeled text. We empirically show that CMOW better
            captures linguistic properties, but it is inferior to CBOW in
            memorizing word content. Motivated by these findings, we propose a
            hybrid model that combines the strengths of CBOW and CMOW. Our
            results show that the hybrid CBOW-CMOW-model retains CBOW's strong
            ability to memorize word content while at the same time
            substantially improving its ability to encode other linguistic
            information by 8\%. As a result, the hybrid also performs better on
            8 out of 11 supervised downstream tasks with an average
            improvement of 1.2\%.}

  abstract = {While there are many studies on information retrieval models
              using full-text, there are presently no comparison studies of
              full-text retrieval vs. retrieval only over the titles of
              documents. On the one hand, the full-text of documents like
              scientific papers is not always available due to, e.g., copyright
              policies of academic publishers. On the other hand, conducting a
              search based on titles alone has strong limitations. Titles are
              short and therefore may not contain enough information to yield
              satisfactory search results. In this paper, we compare different
              retrieval models regarding their search performance on the
              full-text vs. only titles of documents. We use different
              datasets, including the three digital library datasets: EconBiz,
              IREON, and PubMed. The results show that it is possible to build
              effective title-based retrieval models that provide competitive
              results comparable to full-text retrieval. The difference between
              the average evaluation results of the best title-based retrieval
              models is only 3{\%} less than those of the best full-text-based

              By suggesting appropriate tracks, i.\,e., songs to add to a
              playlist, a recommender system can increase the user engagement
              by making playlist creation easier, as well as extending
              listening beyond the end of current playlist. The ACM Recommender
              Systems Challenge 2018 focuses on such task. Spotify released a
              dataset of playlists, which includes a large number of playlists
              and associated track listings. Given a set of playlists from
              which a number of tracks have been withheld, the goal is
              predicting the missing tracks in those playlists. We participated
              in the challenge as the team \emph{Unconscious Bias} and, in this
              paper, we present our approach. We extend adversarial
              autoencoders to the problem of automatic playlist continuation.

              titles as well as track titles, artists and albums, can be

              Our results reveal that supplying the partial item set as input

              libraries, it is often more practical to use metadata such as the
              title of a publication instead of the full-text or the abstract.
              Therefore, it is desirable to have good text mining and text
              classification algorithms that operate well already on the title
              of a publication. So far, the classification performance on
              titles is not competitive with the performance on the full-texts
              if the same number of training samples is used for training.
              However, it is much easier to obtain title data in large
              quantities and to use it for training than full-text data. In
              this paper, we investigate the question how models obtained from
              training on increasing amounts of title training data compare to
              models from training on a constant number of full-texts. We
              evaluate this question on a large-scale dataset from the medical
              domain (PubMed) and from economics (EconBiz). In these datasets,
              the titles and annotations of millions of publications are
              available, and they outnumber the available full-texts by a
              factor of 20 and 15, respectively. To exploit these large amounts
              of data to their full potential, we develop three strong deep
              learning classifiers and evaluate their performance on the two
              datasets. The results are promising. On the EconBiz dataset, all
              three classifiers outperform their full-text counterparts by a
              large margin. The best title-based classifier outperforms the
              best full-text method by 9.9\%. On the PubMed dataset, the best
              title-based method almost reaches the performance of the best
              full-text classifier, with a difference of only 2.9\%.}

              the best competitor to state-of-the-art retrieval models. It can
              be further improved by re-weighting the word frequencies with IDF
              before aggregating the respective word vectors of the embedding.
              The proposed cosine similarity of IDF re-weighted word vectors is
              competitive to the TF-IDF baseline and even outperforms it in
              case of the news domain with a relative percentage of 15\%.}
