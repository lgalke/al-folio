Current graph convolution approaches are promising, especially, when all the graph{\rq}s nodes and edges are available during training. When unseen nodes and edges are inserted after training, it is not yet evaluated whether up-training or re-training from scratch is preferable. We construct an experimental setup, in which we insert previously unseen nodes and edges after training and conduct a limited amount of inference epochs. In this setup, we compare adapting pretrained graph neural networks against retraining from scratch. Our results show that pretrained models yield high accuracy scores on the unseen nodes and that pretraining is preferable over retraining from scratch. Our experiments represent a first step to evaluate and develop truly online variants of graph neural networks.},

	abstract = {Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) is a powerful text embedding method.
            Due to its strong capabilities to encode word content, CBOW
            embeddings perform well on a wide range of downstream tasks while
            being efficient to compute. However, CBOW is not capable of
            capturing the word order. The reason is that the computation of
            CBOW's word embeddings is commutative, i.e., embeddings of XYZ and
            ZYX are the same. In order to address this shortcoming, we propose
            a learning algorithm for the Continuous Matrix Space Model, which
            we call Continual Multiplication of Words (CMOW). Our algorithm is
            an adaptation of word2vec, so that it can be trained on large
            quantities of unlabeled text. We empirically show that CMOW better
            captures linguistic properties, but it is inferior to CBOW in
            memorizing word content. Motivated by these findings, we propose a
            hybrid model that combines the strengths of CBOW and CMOW. Our
            results show that the hybrid CBOW-CMOW-model retains CBOW's strong
            ability to memorize word content while at the same time
            substantially improving its ability to encode other linguistic
            information by 8\%. As a result, the hybrid also performs better on
            8 out of 11 supervised downstream tasks with an average
            improvement of 1.2\%.},

              documents. On the one hand, the full-text of documents like
              scientific papers is not always available due to, e.g., copyright

	abstract = {For (semi-)automated subject indexing systems in digital
              libraries, it is often more practical to use metadata such as the
              title of a publication instead of the full-text or the abstract.
              Therefore, it is desirable to have good text mining and text
              classification algorithms that operate well already on the title
              of a publication. So far, the classification performance on
              titles is not competitive with the performance on the full-texts
              if the same number of training samples is used for training.
              However, it is much easier to obtain title data in large
              quantities and to use it for training than full-text data. In
              this paper, we investigate the question how models obtained from
              training on increasing amounts of title training data compare to
              models from training on a constant number of full-texts. We
              evaluate this question on a large-scale dataset from the medical
              domain (PubMed) and from economics (EconBiz). In these datasets,
              the titles and annotations of millions of publications are
              available, and they outnumber the available full-texts by a
              factor of 20 and 15, respectively. To exploit these large amounts
              of data to their full potential, we develop three strong deep
              learning classifiers and evaluate their performance on the two
              datasets. The results are promising. On the EconBiz dataset, all
              three classifiers outperform their full-text counterparts by a
              large margin. The best title-based classifier outperforms the
              best full-text method by 9.9\%. On the PubMed dataset, the best
              title-based method almost reaches the performance of the best

                    Automated research analyses are becoming more and more important as the volume of
                    research items grows at an increasing pace. 
                    We pursue a new direction for dynamic research analyses with graph neural
                    networks.
                    So far, graph neural networks have only been applied to small-scale datasets and
                    primarily supervised tasks such as node classification.
                    We propose to use an unsupervised training objective for concept representation learning
                    that is tailored towards bibliographic data with millions of research papers and
                    thousands of concepts from a controlled vocabulary.
                    We have evaluated the learned representations in clustering and classification
                    downstream tasks. Furthermore, we have conducted nearest concept queries in the
                    representation space.
                    Our results show that the representations learned by graph
                    convolution with our training objective are comparable to the ones learned by
                    the DeepWalk algorithm.
                    Our findings suggest that concept embeddings can be solely derived from the text
                    of associated documents without using a lookup-table embedding.
                    Thus, graph neural networks can operate on
                    arbitrary document collections without re-training. This property makes graph
                    neural networks useful for dynamic research analysis, which is often

            centroid similarity, dedicated paragraph vectors, the physically inspired Word
            Mover's distance, as well as a novel IDF re-weighted word centroid similarity.

            In our comparison, we thrive to simulate a strictly practical setting: short
            queries, a boolean matching operation, only the first twenty retrieved
            documents are considered. We evaluate the performance using the ranking metrics
            mean average precision, mean reciprocal rank and normalised discounted
            cumulative gain. Additionally, we inspect the retrieval models' sensitivity to
            document length by using either only the title or the full-text as documents.

            We conclude that word centroid similarity is the best competitor to
            state-of-the-art retrieval models and can be further improved by re-weighting
            the word frequencies according to inverse document frequency before aggregating
            the respective word vectors of the embedding. The proposed cosine similarity of
            IDF re-weighted word vectors is competitive to the TF-IDF baseline and even
            outperforms it in case of the news domain with a relative percentage of $15$\%.

            In the context of this research contribution, a dedicated information retrieval
            framework has been developed. The key features include the incorporation of
            embedding-based retrieval models, the simulation of a practical setting,
            automatic evaluation as well as convenient extendability by new retrieval
            models. The corresponding user's guide and developer's guide are part of this
            work.

	abstract = {We summarize our contribution to the International Conference on Learning Representations CBOW Is Not All You Need: Combining CBOW with the Compositional Matrix Space Model, 2019. We construct a text encoder that learns matrix representations of words from unlabeled text, while using matrix multiplication as composition function. We show that our text encoder outperforms continuous bag-of-word representations on 9 out of 10 linguistic probing tasks and argue that the learned representations are complementary to the ones of vector-based approaches. Hence, we construct a hybrid model that jointly learns a matrix and a vector for each word. This hybrid model yields higher scores than purely vector-based approaches on 10 out of 16 downstream tasks in a controlled experiment with the same capacity and training data. Across all 16 tasks, the hybrid model achieves an average improvement of 1.2\%. These results are insofar promising, as they open up new opportunities to efficiently incorporate order awareness into word embedding models.},
