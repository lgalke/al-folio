  abstract = {While there are many studies on information retrieval models
              using full-text, there are presently no comparison studies of
              full-text retrieval vs. retrieval only over the titles of
              documents. On the one hand, the full-text of documents like
              scientific papers is not always available due to, e.g., copyright
              policies of academic publishers. On the other hand, conducting a
              search based on titles alone has strong limitations. Titles are
              short and therefore may not contain enough information to yield
              satisfactory search results. In this paper, we compare different
              retrieval models regarding their search performance on the
              full-text vs. only titles of documents. We use different
              datasets, including the three digital library datasets: EconBiz,
              IREON, and PubMed. The results show that it is possible to build
              effective title-based retrieval models that provide competitive
              results comparable to full-text retrieval. The difference between
              the average evaluation results of the best title-based retrieval
              models is only 3{\%} less than those of the best full-text-based
              retrieval models.},

  abstract = {We analyze the problem of response suggestion in a closed domain
              along a real-world scenario of a digital library. We present a
              text-processing pipeline to generate question-answer pairs from
              chat transcripts. On this limited amount of training data, we
              compare retrieval-based, conditioned-generation, and dedicated
              representation learning approaches for response suggestion. Our
              results show that retrieval-based methods that strive to find
              similar, known contexts are preferable over parametric approaches
              from the conditioned-generation family, when the training data is
              limited. We, however, identify a specific representation learning
              approach that is competitive to the retrieval-based approaches
              despite the training data limitation.},
